# What is PLATO ?

The PLatform for the Analysis, Translation, and Organization of large-scale data (PLATO) is a standalone program written in C++ that is designed to be a flexible and extensible analysis tool for a wide variety of genetic data. PLATO includes a configurable set of QC and analysis steps that can be used for the filtering and analysis of data in a single command step. Further, through the abstraction of genetic data, PLATO allows for the easy addition of customized analysis or filtering steps requiring only a basic level of computing expertise.

# Why use PLATO ?

With the wide array of genotypic and phenotypic data available, there is no single analytical method that is appropriate for all data. In fact, no single method can be optimal for all datasets, especially when the genetic architecture for diseases can vary substantially. PLATO serves as an integrative platform that can accommodate multiple analytical methods for analysis as we learn more about genetic architecture. By allowing for user customization through the use of command line options, PLATO can adapt to many different kinds of data and analyses. Additionally, PLATO has the ability to be run in parallel for some steps, reducing the computing time of the analyses on the multi-core machines that have become standard.
