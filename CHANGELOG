== Version 1.2 ==

New Features:

1.  Added -update-ids command line option. Takes an input file of the format: OldFamID OldIndID NewFamID NewIndID  The ids are updated prior to performing a formatting step (output-ped, output-bin, etc
2.  User can specify covariates to include in linear regression with the -covars-name and -covars-number parameters.
3. MDROutput process can now use alternative phenotype provided by trait-file

Bug Fixes:

1.  In FST calculation checks that the number of groups specified doesn't equal the number of samples.
2.  Replaced code to filter output based on -epi-alpha1 in Epistasis module.
3.  Added markerGreater(...) method to be used as comparator in InputFilter class sorting.  This was a fix for an issue with -excMarkers flag not excluding all markers in the locus input file.
4.  Fixed ExcludeLocusFilter(...) method in InputFilter class to make sure all markers in the input locus file are excluded regardless of order.
5.  Changed to catch MethodException reference so messages are displayed correctly.
6.  In Sample::addMicroSat and MarkerGenoEff::calcOne, changed map access from .at to [] because .at throws an exception when key doesn't exist and in this case, we are adding a new key/value pair to the map
7.  Fixed Helpers::removeBeginWhiteSpace to properly remove whitespace at beginning of string
8.  Added warning to BINOutput when trying to include a microsatellite marker in a plink output file
9.  For LGEN file input, fixed missing data problem so that any marker not appearing in the input file would be set as missing for processing.
10. For Eigenstrat output, corrected 0 and 2 output for alleles in the ancestry map file option.

Output:
1.  Linear Regression now outputs the number of covariates included in the model

Style/Format/Other:
1.  Many lines of commented out code removed.
2.  Moved opening braces to separate lines
3.  Changed STL map and vector access from [] operator to .at function.
4.  Cast size() function of vectors as ints to remove compiler warnings
5.  Removed R dependency and MARS filtering techniques
